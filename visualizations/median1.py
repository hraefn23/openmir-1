def medfilt1(x=None,L=None):

    '''
    a simple median filter for 1d numpy arrays.

    performs a discrete one-dimensional median filter with window
    length L to input vector x. produces a vector the same size 
    as x. boundaries handled by shrinking L at edges; no data
    outside of x used in producing the median filtered output.
    (upon error or exception, returns None.)

    inputs:
    x, Python 1d list or tuple or Numpy array
    L, median filter window length
    output:
    xout, Numpy 1d array of median filtered result; same size as x
